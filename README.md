**GPT-2 Text Generation with Gradio**

An interactive **Text Generation Model** built using **GPT-2**, fine-tuned for coherent and contextually relevant text generation.
This project integrates **Gradio** for a simple and user-friendly web interface, allowing anyone to input a prompt and generate meaningful text responses in real time.


## 🚀 Features
* Fine-tuned **GPT-2** for text generation
* **Interactive GUI** with Gradio
* Built using **Python 3** and **TensorFlow**
* Generates coherent, human-like sentences based on user prompts
* Easy to run in **Google Colab** or locally
